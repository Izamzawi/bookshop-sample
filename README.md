The bookshop application is a clone from a similar project by [Code Step By Step](https://www.youtube.com/c/phpstepbystep), with some adjustments.

The project was built with Laravel 8, while the front-end side with Bootstrap.

## How to use
The landing page will display to visitors a collection of products (books).

To 'purchase' a book(s), visitors must be logged in. Visitors can choose between creating a new account or log in with the available credentials.

The available credential is as below:
```
    'email': new@buyer.com
    'password': newbuyer
```

### Weakness
This bookstore application still lacks security. The user-only page is still accessible via URL and will return an error. However, expect this application to be completed soon.

Thank you.
